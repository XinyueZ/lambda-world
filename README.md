# World of lambda
Here I added more and more usages about lambda.
This is not a tutorial.
This repo provides samples only.
This code repo is in Kotlin just for simple.


### Foreach

1. Use JVM ```foreach``` to loop some outputs.

2. Use JVM ```stream().foreach``` to loop some outputs, Java8 Only.

3. Use a kind of map on ```stream``` to deal on data and output by ```foreach```.

4. Use ```sum``` to get summary of numbers.

5. Use ```parallel```, the order won't be ensured.

6. Use more than one streams to do task, i.e : ```map``` and ```flatMapToInt```  and make ```sum``` .

7. Use ```partitioningBy``` to generate partition collections from stream source.

8. Use inline function which is a feature of Kotlin to simulate ```foreach```.

### Coroutines

1. Basic usage, just call 2 functions that don't depend each other.
