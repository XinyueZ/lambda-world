# World of lambda
Here I added more and more usages about lambda.
This is not a tutorial.
This repo provides samples only.
This code repo is in Kotlin just for simple.

1 .Use JVM ```foreach``` to loop some outputs.
2. Use JVM ```stream().foreach``` to loop some outputs, Java8 Only.
3. Use a kind of map on ```stream``` to dealing on data and output by ```foreach```.
